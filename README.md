## About Me
I am a PhD Researcher at **Saarland University**, Germany, and a Scientific Researcher at the **German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)**. My research focuses on developing advanced machine learning techniques, specifically in spatio-temporal analysis, multivariate sequential learning, and longitudinal analysis. I am working on designing robust methods for anomaly detection and investigating the capabilities of foundation models, including **Large Language Models**, to enhance their application across various domains.

My current projects involve applying these methodologies to areas such as doping detection in sports, healthcare analytics, and quantum machine learning. By combining theoretical advancements with practical applications, I aim to contribute to the development of data-driven solutions that address complex challenges in these fields.
